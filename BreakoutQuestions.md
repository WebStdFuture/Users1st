# Questions for Breakout Session

## Do "users" exist as a group whose needs we can understand and address?

## What problems happen when standards  don't pay  attention to end user needs? Examples?

## What can W3C do to address these problems?
Process changes? Value statements? Governance change? Recruit different members?

## What challenges might come up if we move forward with these ideas?

Will many members object to W3C changing the ground rules?

## What next steps might we agree to take?
- Explicitly document W3C's consensus on core user values?
- Accept that the membership could shrink as we focus on core values?
- Double down on user agents as the mechanisms to pursue the values?
- Accept that W3C is an advocacy organization for those values not just a technical SDO?
