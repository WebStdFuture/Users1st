# Can Users Really Make a Difference in a Web Dominated by BigTech?
There's a narrative going around in W3C these days (member confidential, sorry) that there's little evidence of users voting with their feet against the the dominant powers' technology choices: The winners today impose defaults and create incentives that ensures they continue to dominate tomorrow.  So (I guess) there's no point in trying harder to engage, listen to, and empower users in standards discussions.

There's no denying that dominant companies TRY to perpetuate their market power to the future. But let’s consider various episodes over the span of W3C’s history where users voting with the wallets and eyeballs/fingers have changed the evolution of the web, despite efforts of the current winners to pick the future winners:

-  Users rejected attempts to enforce HTML validity and chose browsers that obeyed Postel's Law /  accepted anything plausibly HTML-like

-  Despite lots of Big Tech hype, users rejected XML and the draconian error handling fragility it required.  (XML found niches only where it is machine-generated and consumed, untouched by human hands or seen by human eyeballs)

- They never bothered much with semantic metadata in websites (Dublin Core etc.) but flocked to search engines that used text and link analysis to deduce topic relevance

- BUT they happily put in Facebook Open Graph meta tags once it directly contributed to visible difference in user experience in link-previews

- Users chose to use "social media" sites one after another  (Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter) instead of the "open web” … without dollars or coercive deals.

- They pretty much ignored the massive industry hype and pressure from incumbents about SOAP web services,  and stuck with plain ol’ HTTP.   (I vividly remember attending a SOAP evangelism event in 2003 — about a year before I got assimilated — where I left  depressed that MS and IBM were going  to embrace, extend, extinguish HTTP and re-assert dominance over the Web.  Didn’t work out that way … )

- And most directly to the point, users drove the decline of IE and the rise of Opera, then Firefox, then Chrome.  Despite all Microsoft did to make IE the default  and bake it into the dominant OS, users turned it into "the thing you use to download Chrome on your new computer”.


Maybe they're right that the current situation will self-perpetuate without users being able to do anything about it, except maybe encourage governments to break up or shackle the dominant powers.  Or (my prediction) users will seek out things that meet their needs,  irrespective of the incumbents’ incentives. And in doing so, they may bring about a new generation of dominant companies, and Google and Apple will join Microsoft, IBM, ATT, etc.  in the roster of  formerly dominant superpowers. And if it still exists in 20 years, the next generation of W3C’ers will complain about them and bemoan the futility of resistance.
